# Chapter 4: Stakeholders, Ethics, and Corporate Social Responsibility

## I. Stakeholders and Stakeholder Management

- **Stakeholder Definition:** Individuals, groups, or organizations who have a stake in the
  organization's success and operations. They are involved in an exchange relationship,
  providing resources and receiving benefits.

- **Types of Stakeholders:**

  - **Internal Stakeholders:** Employees, managers, owners.
  - **External Stakeholders:** Customers, suppliers, creditors, governments, communities,
    general public.

- **Stakeholder Impact Analysis:** A systematic process to identify, analyze, and prioritize
  stakeholder claims:

  1. **Identify stakeholders:** Determine who is affected.
  2. **Identify stakeholder interests:** Understand their concerns and what they value.
  3. **Identify stakeholder claims:** Determine what they expect from the organization.
  4. **Identify actions to satisfy claims:** Develop strategies to address stakeholder needs.
  5. **Weight stakeholders:** Prioritize stakeholders based on their importance to the
     organization (e.g., customers, employees, shareholders are often prioritized).
  6. **Take actions:** Implement strategies, starting with the most important stakeholders.

- **Balancing Competing Claims:** Stakeholder interests often conflict; managers must
  prioritize and find solutions that balance competing demands. Example: Employee
  demands for higher wages may conflict with shareholder demands for higher profits and
  consumer demands for lower prices. Monsanto's experience with genetically modified
  foods illustrates the challenges of managing diverse stakeholder interests.

## II. Business Ethics

- **Definition:** Accepted principles of right and wrong governing the conduct of
  businesspeople. This goes beyond simply complying with the law.

- **Common Ethical Issues:**
  - **Self-dealing:** Managers using company resources for personal gain. Example:
    Dennis Kozlowski at Tyco.
  - **Information manipulation:** Distorting or hiding information to benefit the firm or
    managers. Example: Enron.
  - **Anticompetitive behavior:** Actions designed to harm competitors. Example:
    Microsoft.
  - **Opportunistic exploitation:** Taking advantage of suppliers or other stakeholders.
    Example: Boeing's dealings with Titanium Metals.
  - **Substandard working conditions:** Unsafe conditions or low wages. Example: Nike.
  - **Environmental degradation:** Causing pollution or other environmental harm.
  - **Corruption:** Bribery. Example: Halliburton in Nigeria.

## III. Philosophical Approaches to Ethics

- **Utilitarian Approach:** Focuses on consequences; actions are judged based on whether
  they maximize overall good and minimize harm. This approach is criticized for its
  difficulty in measuring outcomes and for potentially ignoring justice.

- **Rights Theories:** Emphasizes fundamental rights and privileges; actions should not
  violate these rights. This approach is concerned with respecting the rights of
  stakeholders.

- **Justice Theories:** Focus on fair and equitable distribution of resources. John Rawls's
  theory suggests that just principles are those that everyone would agree to under a "veil of
  ignorance" (ignorance of one's own position in society). This leads to the difference
  principleâ€”inequalities are justified only if they benefit the least advantaged members of
  society.

## IV. Behaving Ethically

- **Strategies for Promoting Ethical Behavior:**
  - **Hire and Promote Ethical Individuals:** Selection processes should assess ethical
    values.
  - **Build an Ethical Organizational Culture:** Develop a code of ethics, emphasize ethical
    behavior in leadership, and incorporate ethical considerations into decision-making
    processes.
  - **Develop Strong Governance Processes:** Independent board of directors, separation
    of CEO and chair, independent compensation and audit committees.
  - **Appoint Ethics Officers:** To ensure ethical awareness and compliance.
  - **Act with Moral Courage:** Protect whistleblowers and encourage reporting of
    unethical behavior. Example: Unilever's policy of protecting employees who report
    ethical violations.

## V. Social Responsibility

- **Definition:** Managers considering the social consequences of their decisions.

- **Arguments for Social Responsibility:**

  - Ethical obligation to society.
  - Long-term self-interest (positive reputation, stakeholder support). Example: BP's
    environmental and community initiatives.

- **The Friedman Doctrine:** The only social responsibility of business is to increase profits
  within the rules of the game. This is a contrasting viewpoint that emphasizes shareholder
  value above all else. The chapter analyzes arguments for and against this perspective.
