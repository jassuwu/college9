# Chapter 10: Organizational Culture

**I. What is Organizational Culture?**

- Definition: The shared values and assumptions within an organization. It guides behavior and shapes decisions.
- Two main components:

  - **Shared Values:** Conscious beliefs evaluating what's good/bad, right/wrong. These can be _espoused values- (what people say they value) or \_enacted values_ (what people actually do).
  - **Shared Assumptions:** Unconscious, taken-for-granted perceptions and beliefs; mental models of ideals. These are the deepest and hardest to change aspect of culture.

- **Artifacts:** Observable symbols and signs of a culture:
  - Stories and legends: Narratives that transmit values and expectations.
  - Rituals and ceremonies: Programmed routines and planned activities that dramatize values.
  - Organizational language: How people communicate; jargon, slang, metaphors.
  - Physical structures and décor: Building design, office layout, décor that communicate values. Example: Oakley's fortress-like headquarters symbolizing its protective culture.

**II. Importance of Organizational Culture:**

1. **Culture Strength and Fit:**

- **Culture Strength:** How widely and deeply employees hold dominant values and assumptions. Strong cultures are more effective when their content aligns with the organization’s environment. A misalignment can lead to dysfunctional behaviors.
- **Example:** Home Depot's shift from an entrepreneurial culture to a more structured, efficient one to meet increased competition.

2. **Corporate Cults and Suppression of Dissent:**

- Very strong cultures can become corporate cults, blinding employees to new opportunities or problems. This can lead to missed opportunities and slow adaptation.
- Suppression of dissenting subcultures prevents valuable critique and innovation.

3. **Adaptive Cultures:**

- Employees focus on customer needs and support initiatives to keep pace with change; external focus.
- Continuous improvement of internal processes.
- Strong sense of ownership and proactive behavior.
- Example: How some McDonald's locations in France adapted their menus and
  restaurant designs to suit the local market, then shared these changes globally.

4. **Organizational Culture and Business Ethics:**

- Culture influences ethical conduct; ethical values should be embedded in the dominant culture.
- Examples: Dell's emphasis on ethical behavior as part of its new cultural values ("Soul of Dell"); Citibank Japan's numbers-focused culture leading to ethical lapses.

**III. Changing and Strengthening Organizational Culture:**

1. **Actions of Founders and Leaders:** Founders and leaders establish and shape culture through their actions, words, and symbolic behaviors. Example: Zhang Ruimin’s sledgehammer incident at Haier Group symbolized a shift to a quality-focused culture.

2. **Aligning Artifacts:** Modifying or creating artifacts to reinforce desired cultural values. Example: Home Depot's shift to more data-driven performance evaluations to reinforce performance orientation.

3. **Introducing Culturally Consistent Rewards:** Reward systems that reward culturally consistent behaviors; this aligns individual and organizational goals. Example: Dell’s incorporation of employee feedback into manager compensation.

4. **Selecting and Socializing Employees:**

- Hiring individuals whose values align with the desired culture (person-organization fit).
- Using organizational socialization to help new hires internalize the values and assumptions of the organization. Example: Bristol-Myers's focus on hiring individuals compatible with its team-oriented culture.

**IV. Managing Organizational Culture During Mergers:**

- **Bicultural Audit:** Diagnoses cultural relations between merging firms to identify potential conflicts and common ground.
- **Merger Strategies:**
  - **Assimilation:** Acquired company adopts the acquiring company's culture.
  - **Deculturation:** Acquired company’s culture is replaced by acquiring firm's culture.
  - **Integration:** Combining the cultures into a new composite culture.
  - **Separation:** Merging companies remain distinct with minimal culture exchange.
- **Example:** Schwab's acquisition of U.S. Trust, illustrating the challenges of cultural
  mergers and the potential failure of a separation strategy.
