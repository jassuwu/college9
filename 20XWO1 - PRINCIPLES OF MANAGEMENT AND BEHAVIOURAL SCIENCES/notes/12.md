# Chapter 12: Staffing and Developing a Diverse Workforce

**I. Human Resource (HR) Planning:** Ensuring the right people are in the right places at the right time to achieve organizational goals cost-effectively.

**Five Steps:**

1. **Job Analysis:** Systematically investigating and documenting job duties, tools, conditions, and required competencies. Results in job descriptions and specifications. Note: The importance of job analysis is emphasized, even though many firms use less formal methods due to the increasing prevalence of multiskilled teams.

2. **Estimate Future HR Demand:** Predicting the number and type of employees needed based on organizational strategy, operational plans, and anticipated future demand. Both macro-level (overall workforce needs) and micro-level (specific skill needs) estimations are important. Example: Conroe Independent School District estimating teacher needs based on projected student enrollment.

3. **Document Current HR Supply:** Determining the number of employees currently in various job categories and their skills. This often involves using sophisticated HR information systems.

4. **Estimate Future Internal HR Supply:** Predicting how many current employees will be available for different roles in the future (considering retirements, promotions, transfers, etc.). Both macro and micro approaches are used. Example: Dofasco, Inc. using a combination of macro and micro level analyses to predict future managerial supply.

5. **Estimate Future External HR Supply:** Assessing the availability of qualified applicants in the external labor market. This is particularly important in times of skill shortages or high competition for talent. Example: Anhalt Elektro Motor Works adjusting its staffing strategy to account for a projected decline in young workers.

**Contingent Workforce:**
_ Definition: Employees without long-term contracts or with variable work hours (temporary employees, contractors).
_ Advantages: Flexibility, cost savings, access to specialized skills. \* Disadvantages: Reduced loyalty, potential for inequity, lower skill levels.

**II. Staffing a Diverse Workforce:**

1. **Workforce Diversity:** Differences in demographic, cultural, and personal characteristics of employees. Importance is linked to both ethical considerations and competitive advantage.

2. **Surface-level Diversity:** Observable differences (race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability).

3. **Deep-level Diversity:** Psychological characteristics (personality, values, beliefs, attitudes). Examples: Differences in work values across generations (baby boomers vs. Generation X/Y).

4. **Is Diversity Important?**

   - Ethical and legal imperative: Laws prohibit discrimination based on protected characteristics (race, gender, age, religion, disability).
   - Business advantage: Diverse workforces can lead to better decision making, improved
     innovation, and better understanding of diverse customer needs. However, the benefits
     are not always guaranteed and are dependent on several factors (including managing
     conflict arising from diversity). \* Examples: Google's efforts to recruit more women in technology; Lockheed Martin's
     diversity maturity model; Southern California Gas Co. and MONY Group leveraging
     diversity to better serve their customer bases.

**III. Recruiting Job Applicants:**

1. **Employer Branding:** Building a positive reputation as an employer. This is crucial for attracting and retaining talent, especially in competitive labor markets. Example: Compass Group developing a new slogan to improve its employer brand.

2. **Internal vs. External Recruitment:**

   - **Internal:** Promoting from within; advantages include lower costs, faster recruitment,
     better knowledge of candidate, employee motivation.
   - **External:** Hiring from outside; necessary for entry-level positions and filling skill
     gaps. This may also infuse new perspectives and improve organizational culture. \* Example: Google relying heavily on external recruitment due to rapid growth and
     demand for specific skills. Procter & Gamble shifting from internal to external hiring
     to boost innovation and introduce new perspectives.

3. **Recruiting Channels:**

   - Internal job postings (intranet).
   - Employee referrals (inexpensive, detailed information about company).
   - Advertisements (print, online).
   - Campus recruiting.
   - Employment agencies and executive search firms.
   - _Online Recruitment (e-Recruitment):_ Cost and time-effective; wide reach; examples
     include Sainsbury's and Nike. \* _Guerrilla Recruitment:_ Proactive, creative approaches to attract highly qualified
     candidates. Examples: Google's Code Jam, Summer of Code, and cryptic recruitment
     campaigns.

**IV. Selecting Job Applicants:**

1. **Reliability and Validity:**

   - **Reliability:** Consistency of a selection method's measurements.
   - **Validity:** How well a method predicts an applicant's suitability for the job (performance, turnover, organizational fit). The emphasis is on using methods that are close to
     being samples (past behavior, work simulations) rather than just signs (personality
     tests).

2. **Selection Methods:**

   1. **Application Forms and Résumés:** Often used for initial screening, but prone to
      inaccuracies. Weighted application blanks can be more valid.
   2. **Reference Checks:** Verifying information on application forms and résumés, but
      often limited by legal concerns.
   3. **Work Sample Tests:** Requiring applicants to perform job-related tasks; generally high
      validity (e.g., musicians performing auditions, assessment centers). Example:
      Honda America using evaluation hiring.
   4. **Employment Interviews:** Highly popular, but traditional unstructured interviews
      have low validity due to inconsistency, irrelevant questions, and interviewer biases.
      _Improving Interview Validity_: Structured interviews (patterned behavior
      description interviews); multiple interviewers; training to reduce biases. Example:
      DaimlerChrysler's use of patterned behavior description interviews.
   5. **Ability Tests:** Measuring current knowledge or potential abilities; usually moderate
      validity.
   6. **Personality Tests:** Measuring personality traits; validity is lower but increasing in
      usefulness.

3. **Selection and Diversity:** Careful consideration of how selection methods might
   adversely impact underrepresented groups. Addressing adverse impact through affirmative action (outreach programs, reasonable accommodations).

**V. Orienting and Developing Employees:**

1. **Employee Orientation:** Helping new employees adapt to the work context; this
   should start before hiring (realistic job preview). Example: Laidlaw’s realistic job preview
   showing applicants a video of a bus driver's worst day.

2. **Training Needs Analysis:**

   - **Performance Gap Analysis:** Identifying skill deficiencies in individual employees.
   - **Organizational Analysis:** Predicting skill needs based on organizational strategy and
     operational plans.

3. **Training Methods:** Lectures, readings, discussions, audiovisual materials, computerbased training, coaching/mentoring, job rotation, simulations/role-playing, action learning. The choice depends on the type of knowledge and skills to be transferred.
