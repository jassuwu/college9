# Chapter 13: Motivating and Rewarding Employee Performance

## I. MARS Model of Individual Behavior and Results

- **MARS Model:** A model explaining the four factors influencing employee behavior and
  performance: **M**otivation, **A**bility, **R**ole Perceptions, **S**ituational Factors.

- **Motivation:** The forces within a person affecting the direction, intensity, and persistence
  of effort toward a goal. It's goal-directed, not random. Example: Two employees may
  both be motivated to finish a project early (direction), but one may exert more effort
  (intensity) and persistence than the other.

- **Ability:** The natural aptitudes and learned capabilities required to perform a task
  successfully. This is improved through hiring, training, and job design. Example: AT&T
  redesigning jobs to match employee capabilities.

- **Role Perceptions:** Understanding one's specific tasks, their importance, and preferred
  behaviors. Improved through job descriptions, coaching, and feedback.

- **Situational Factors:** Conditions beyond an employee's control that constrain or
  facilitate performance. These can be internal (resources, support) or external (market
  conditions). Example: Metro's train derailments partly caused by poor role perceptions
  (lack of awareness of lubrication responsibilities).

## II. Motivating Employees: A Three-Part Process

The chapter outlines a three-part process for managing employee motivation:

**A. Understanding and Guiding Drives and Needs:**

- **Drives:** Hardwired, instinctive needs (acquire, bond, learn, defend).
- **Needs:** Conscious deficiencies energizing behavior. Needs are shaped by drives,
  learning, and social influences.
- **Maslow's Needs Hierarchy Theory:** A hierarchical model of needs (physiological,
  safety, belongingness, esteem, self-actualization). While popular, its research support is
  limited. The chapter discusses its limitations but acknowledges its practical value as a
  reminder of the diverse needs employees have.
- **Learned Needs Theory (McClelland):** Need strength is shaped by learning and social
  influences. Three key needs: achievement (nAch), affiliation (nAff), power (nPow).
  Example: General Electric's culture fostering a strong need for achievement.
- **Four-Drive Theory:** Four innate drives (acquire, bond, learn, defend) influence
  emotions, which then, through the individualâ€™s mental skill set (reasoning, values,
  norms), shape needs and behavior. Example: ACUITY's transformation improving
  employee motivation by addressing all four drives.

**B. Directing Effort through Goals, Expectations, and Feedback:**

- **Goal Setting:** Motivates employees and clarifies role perceptions by establishing
  performance objectives. Effective goals are specific, measurable, important, challenging
  (but realistic), and time-bound. Example: Speedera Networks using a Hawaiian trip as a
  motivational goal.
- **Feedback:** Information about goal progress; essential for motivation and self-actualization. Effective feedback is specific, timely, frequent, and credible. Example: Microsoft and
  Verizon using executive dashboards for real-time feedback.
- **Expectancy Theory:** Effort is directed toward behaviors leading to valued outcomes.
  - **E-to-P Expectancy:** Belief that effort will lead to performance.
  - **P-to-O Expectancy:** Belief that performance will lead to outcomes.
  - **Outcome Valences:** Value attached to outcomes. Example: ACUITY's change in
    sick leave policy to improve P-to-O expectancy.

**C. Designing Extrinsic and Intrinsic Rewards:**

- **Extrinsic Rewards:** Received from another person (pay, bonuses, praise). These serve
  four objectives:

  - **Membership/seniority-based:** Attracts applicants, reduces turnover but doesn't
    directly motivate performance. Example: Japan's age-based pay systems.
  - **Job status-based:** Rewards based on job level; creates a fair system but can
    reinforce hierarchy.
  - **Competency-based:** Rewards for skills and knowledge; increases flexibility and
    quality. Example: Marley Cooling Tower's skill-based pay.
  - **Performance-based:** Rewards linked to individual or team performance (e.g.,
    commissions, piece rates, gainsharing, profit sharing, stock options, balanced
    scorecards). Example: John Deere's gainsharing plan. The chapter emphasizes the
    importance of accurate performance measurement and equitable reward distribution to
    maximize the effectiveness of performance-based rewards.

- **Nonfinancial Rewards:** Praise, recognition, opportunities for growth. Example: Yum!
  Brands' peer-recognition program.

- **Intrinsic Rewards:** Positive emotional experiences from the work itself. This is enhanced
  through job design.

## III. Motivating Employees through Intrinsic Rewards

- **Job Characteristics Model:** Five core job dimensions influencing intrinsic motivation:

  - Skill variety.
  - Task identity.
  - Task significance.
  - Autonomy.
  - Job feedback.
    These dimensions affect three critical psychological states (experienced meaningfulness,
    experienced responsibility, knowledge of results), leading to higher motivation and
    performance.

- **Job Enrichment:** Giving employees more responsibility and control over their work;
  this increases intrinsic motivation.

- **Empowerment:** Providing employees with self-determination, meaning, competence,
  and impact in their work. Example: Semco Corporation's high level of employee
  empowerment.
