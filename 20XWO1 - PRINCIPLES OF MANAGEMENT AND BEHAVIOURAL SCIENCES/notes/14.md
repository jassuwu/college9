# Chapter 14: Managing Employee Attitudes and Well-Being

**I. Emotions in the Workplace:**

- **Emotions:** Brief, intense, directed feelings that create a state of readiness. They are distinct from moods, which are less intense and not directed at a specific target.
- **Emotions' Influence:** Emotions significantly impact thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors. Ignoring the role of emotions limits our understanding of workplace dynamics.
- **Example:** CXtec's use of fun activities to generate positive emotions and improve employee morale.

**II. Emotions, Attitudes, and Behavior:**

- **Attitudes:** Clusters of beliefs, feelings, and behavioral intentions toward an object, person, or event. Attitudes are judgments, emotions are experiences.
- **Model of Emotions, Attitudes, and Behavior:** Beliefs shape feelings, which influence behavioral intentions, which in turn affect behavior (though not perfectly, as other MARS model factors also play a role).
- **Emotions' Impact on Attitudes:** Emotions experienced during work shape longer-term attitudes toward the job, company, boss, and coworkers. Positive emotions lead to positive attitudes.
- **Example:** Google's Googleplex designed to promote positive emotions. Pike Place Fish Market's fun work environment leading to improved employee attitudes.

**III. Cognitive Dissonance:**

- Definition: An uncomfortable tension experienced when behavior contradicts attitudes. The strength of this tension depends on the behavior's public visibility, importance, and voluntariness.
- Reducing Dissonance: People typically change their attitudes to align with their behavior rather than change their actions (since the behavior has already occurred).
- Example: A manager who lectures employees about punctuality but frequently arrives late
  himself may change his attitude towards punctuality to reduce cognitive dissonance.

**IV. Job Satisfaction:**

- Definition: A person's evaluation of his or her job and work context; involves appraisal of
  job characteristics, work environment, and emotional experiences.
- **Job Satisfaction and Work Behavior:** Job dissatisfaction leads to responses according to the EVLN model (exit, voice, loyalty, neglect). The choice of response depends on individual
  characteristics and situational factors.
- **Job Satisfaction and Performance:** A moderate positive correlation exists between job
  satisfaction and performance, but the relationship is complex. Job satisfaction may lead to
  higher performance (especially in complex jobs), but higher performance (especially when
  linked to rewards) may also lead to job satisfaction.
- **Job Satisfaction and Customer Satisfaction:** Positive correlation exists; happy employees
  tend to provide better customer service, leading to higher customer satisfaction and
  loyalty. Example: Outback Steakhouse's success partially attributed to its emphasis on
  employee satisfaction. The employee-customer-profit chain model illustrates this
  relationship.

**V. Organizational Commitment:**

- Definition: An employee's emotional attachment to, identification with, and involvement
  in an organization.
- **Consequences:** Reduced turnover, absenteeism, improved customer service, higher
  motivation and performance.
- **Continuance Commitment:** Calculative attachment; staying only because leaving would
  be costly (e.g., losing deferred compensation). This is different from and often negatively
  correlated with organizational commitment. It can lead to lower performance and less
  organizational citizenship behavior.
- **Building Organizational Commitment:** Building trust, ensuring justice and support,
  creating shared values, promoting organizational comprehension, and involving employees
  in decision making. Example: VanCity's employee-first philosophy resulting in high
  employee loyalty and low turnover.

**VI. Work-Related Stress and Its Management:**

- **Stress:** An adaptive response to a challenging or threatening situation. Eustress (positive
  stress) is motivating; distress (negative stress) is harmful.
- **General Adaptation Syndrome:** Three stages: alarm reaction, resistance, exhaustion.
- **Consequences of Distress:** Physical (headaches, cardiovascular problems);
  psychological (dissatisfaction, depression); behavioral (poor performance, accidents,
  absenteeism).
- **Stressors:**
  - Harassment and incivility (psychological harassment, sexual harassment). Example:
    Devander Naidu's experience of psychological harassment.
  - Work overload: Working more hours than one can cope with.
  - Low task control: Lack of control over work pace, schedule, or procedures.
- **Managing Work-Related Stress:**
  - **Withdraw from the stressor:** Temporary (breaks, vacations) or permanent (job
    change). Example: Brann Baltimore creating a relaxing Aquarium Room.
  - **Change stress perceptions:** Increase self-confidence and optimism. Example:
    Using humor to reduce stress.
  - **Control stress consequences:** Physical exercise, relaxation techniques, wellness
    programs. Example: AstraZeneca employees using Qi Gong.
  - **Receive social support:** Emotional and informational support from others;
    supportive leadership.
  - **Remove the stressor:** Address the root causes of stress (noise, safety, harassment,
    work overload, low task control). Example: Best Buy implementing ROWE (results-oriented work environment) to give employees more control over their work schedules.

**VII. Work–Life Balance:**

- Definition: Minimal conflict between work and nonwork demands. This has become a
  key issue in today's employment relationships, driven by two-income families, increased
  work hours, and changing generational expectations.
- **Strategies:** Flexible work hours (ROWE), job sharing, personal leave, telecommuting.
- Example: Best Buy’s ROWE initiative; Volvo’s generous maternity leave; Karen Dunn
  Kelley's telecommuting arrangement. The chapter notes both the potential benefits and
  challenges of telecommuting.

**VIII. Personality Effects on Attitudes and Well-Being:**

- **Personality:** Relatively stable pattern of behaviors and internal states.
- **Big Five Personality Dimensions:** Conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism,
  openness to experience, extroversion (CANOE).
- **Personality and Emotions/Attitudes:** Extroversion and emotional stability are associated
  with positive emotions and attitudes; introversion and neuroticism are associated with
  negative emotions.
- **Personality and Stress/Well-being:** Conscientiousness, extroversion, and emotional
  stability are associated with higher resilience.
- **Personality and Performance:** Conscientiousness is the strongest predictor of job
  performance across various jobs.
- **Personality and Career Satisfaction:** Holland's vocational fit theory emphasizes
  matching personalities with work environments (realistic, investigative, artistic, social,
  enterprising, conventional).
