# Chapter 3: Globalization and the Manager

**I. What is Globalization?**

- Definition: The process of national economies and business systems becoming deeply interlinked. This is not a new phenomenon, but its pace has significantly accelerated since the 1980s.

**II. Processes Driving Globalization:**

1. **Spread of Market-Based Economic Systems:**

   - Shift from centrally planned (socialist) economies to market economies.
   - Key elements: Privatization of state-owned enterprises; dismantling of state monopolies; deregulation (removal of price controls, investment restrictions); establishment of legal systems protecting property rights. \* Examples: Privatization of British Telecom, market reforms in Brazil and India, China's move toward a market economy. This increased openness to foreign investment and trade fuels globalization.

2. **Falling Barriers to Trade and Investment:**

   - Reduced tariffs and quotas through international agreements (GATT, WTO).
   - Increased regional trade agreements (EU, NAFTA): Reduced barriers to trade and investment within geographic regions. \* Bilateral agreements: Numerous treaties between pairs of nations further reducing barriers to FDI.

3. **Falling Communication and Transportation Costs:**
   - Technological advancements: Satellites, fiber optics, wireless technologies, the internet significantly reduced communication costs.
   - Examples: Decreasing cost of international phone calls; rapid growth of the World Wide Web; Web-based transactions. \* Transportation: Commercial jet aircraft, superfreighters, containerization dramatically reduced transportation costs. Examples: Cost reductions in ocean freight, airfreight's increased share in US trade.

**III. Implications of Globalization:**

1. **Globalization of Production:**

   - Definition: Sourcing goods and services globally to leverage national differences in cost and quality.
   - Motivations: Lower costs, improved quality. \* Examples: Boeing's 777 and 787 outsourcing; outsourcing of service activities (customer service centers, software development).

2. **Globalization of Markets:**

   - Definition: Merging of historically distinct national markets into one huge global marketplace.
   - Drivers: Falling trade barriers, convergence of consumer tastes (global brands). \* Examples: Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Starbucks, Sony. Competition between the same firms in multiple countries is a key feature.

3. **Technology as a Facilitator:**
   - Technological advancements facilitated both globalization of production and markets. The internet is particularly important for coordinating global operations and facilitating international trade in services.
   - Example: Dell's use of the internet to manage its globally dispersed supply chain (just-in-time inventory).

**IV. Constraints on Globalization:**

1. **Protectionist Countertrends:** National concerns about job losses, unfair competition, and the "race to the bottom" can lead to protectionist policies (tariffs, quotas). This is a threat to further globalization.

2. **National Differences in Consumer Behavior:** Significant differences in consumer tastes and preferences across nations require product and marketing customization. This limits the extent to which the world can be treated as a single market.

3. **National Differences in Business Systems:** Variations in legal systems, infrastructure, business practices, and levels of economic development limit the extent of globalization.

4. **Differences in Social Culture:** Cultural differences significantly impact management practices and marketing strategies. Requires adaptation and cultural sensitivity. Examples: Differences in management styles between U.S. and Saudi Arabia; differences in attitudes toward advertising pharmaceuticals across nations.

**V. Benefits of Going Global:**

- Expanding the market for products.
- Achieving scale economies.
- Achieving location economies.
- Global learning.

**VI. Management Challenges in the Global Enterprise:**

- Balancing global standardization and local customization.
- Selecting appropriate entry modes for foreign markets.
- Strategically locating activities across the globe.
- Effectively managing a diverse multinational workforce (expatriate management, staffing policies).
