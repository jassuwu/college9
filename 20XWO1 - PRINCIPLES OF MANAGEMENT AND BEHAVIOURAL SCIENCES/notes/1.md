- **Key functions of management**: Planning, strategizing, organizing, controlling, leading, and developing employees.

#### The Functions of Management
1. **Planning and Strategizing**
   - **Planning**: Formal process to set goals, identify actions, allocate responsibilities, measure success, and revise plans accordingly. It occurs at multiple levels within an organization.
   - **Strategizing**: Continuous process of selecting goals and strategies, analyzing competitors, and adapting to changes in the environment. Example: Starbucks' music venture started by a store manager’s initiative, which later became part of the company's strategy.

2. **Organizing**
   - **Organizing**: Deciding who performs tasks, where decisions are made, who reports to whom, and how different parts of the organization coordinate to pursue goals. This involves creating subunits like procurement, R&D, marketing, etc.
   - Example: Starbucks set up a separate unit called Hear Music for their music retailing strategy, demonstrating the organizing function.

3. **Controlling**
   - **Controlling**: Monitoring performance against goals, taking corrective actions, and ensuring alignment with organizational objectives. It involves creating incentives to motivate employees.
   - Example: Starbucks uses stock-based compensation to align employee interests with organizational goals, reducing the need for close supervision.

4. **Leading and Developing Employees**
   - **Leading**: Motivating, influencing, and directing others to work productively towards organizational goals. It also involves articulating a strategic vision and being a strong advocate for it.
   - **Developing Employees**: Hiring, training, mentoring, and rewarding employees. It's crucial for building human capital, which is a competitive advantage.
   - Example: Jack Welch spent 70% of his time developing and selecting managers at General Electric.

#### Types of Managers

   - CEOs and top executives who formulate strategies for the entire enterprise. Example: Jeffery Immelt at GE.

   - Head divisions within a multi-business enterprise, translating corporate strategies into actionable plans. Example: Heads of GE’s different business units.

3. **Functional Managers**:
   - Lead specific functions like marketing or production within divisions. They develop functional strategies and draft plans to achieve strategic objectives. Example: Manufacturing managers at GE’s aerospace business.
   - Responsibilities: Developing human capital, organizing subunits, and implementing corporate strategies.

4. **Frontline Managers**:
   - Manage employees who are not managers and oversee operational activities. Example: Frontline managers at BP overseeing 80% of the workforce.

#### Becoming a Manager
