# Chapter 8: Organizing

## I. Organization Architecture

- **Definition:** The totality of a firm's organization, encompassing:

  - **Formal Organization Structure:** How decision-making responsibilities are
    located (centralization vs. decentralization), how the organization is divided into
    subunits, and integrating mechanisms used to coordinate subunits.
  - **Control Systems:** Metrics used to measure subunit performance.
  - **Incentive Systems:** Mechanisms used to motivate desired behaviors.
  - **Organizational Culture:** Shared values and assumptions.
  - **People:** Employees, hiring strategies, and human capital.

- **Interdependence of Components:** These elements are interconnected and influence
  each other. A firm's organization architecture must support its strategy and operations.
  Example: Nucor Steel's low-cost strategy is supported by its decentralized structure,
  incentive systems, and organizational culture.

## II. Designing Structure: Vertical Differentiation

- **Vertical Differentiation:** The location of decision-making responsibilities within the
  hierarchy.

- **A. Centralization vs. Decentralization:**

  - **Centralization:** Decision-making authority concentrated at higher levels.
    - **Advantages:** Coordination, consistency with organizational goals, avoids
      duplication, facilitates organizational change.
    - **Disadvantages:** Overburdened top management, reduced motivation, less
      flexibility, poorer decisions (bounded rationality, cognitive biases). Example: WalMart's centralized purchasing but decentralized store operations.
  - **Decentralization:** Decision-making authority distributed to lower levels.
    - **Advantages:** Reduces top management workload, increases motivation,
      provides flexibility, better decisions (information closer to source), enhances
      control (autonomous subunits, accountability).
    - **Disadvantages:** Potential for inconsistent decisions, coordination challenges. Example: Google's decentralized approach to innovation.

- **B. Tall vs. Flat Hierarchies:**
  - **Tall Hierarchies:** Many layers of management.
    - **Advantages:** Close supervision, clear reporting lines.
    - **Disadvantages:** Information distortion, influence costs (deliberate information
      distortion), high overhead costs, inertia (resistance to change).
  - **Flat Hierarchies:** Few layers of management.
    - **Advantages:** Faster communication, greater flexibility, reduced costs, less
      inertia.
    - **Disadvantages:** Overburdened managers, potential loss of control.
  - **Delayering:** Reducing the number of layers in a hierarchy to create a flatter
    structure. Example: Jack Welch's delayering at General Electric.

## III. Designing Structure: Horizontal Differentiation

- **Horizontal Differentiation:** Dividing the organization into subunits.

- **A. Functional Structure:** Organizing around functions (production, marketing, R&D,
  etc.).

  - **Advantages:** Efficiency, specialization.
  - **Disadvantages:** Poor coordination across functions, slow response to change,
    difficult to manage diversification.

- **B. Multidivisional Structure:** Organizing around product divisions; each division
  responsible for a distinct business area. Example: Philips NV.

  - **Advantages:** Clear accountability for business performance, facilitates
    diversification.
  - **Disadvantages:** Duplication of functions across divisions, potential for conflict
    between divisions and headquarters.

- **C. Geographic Structure:** Organizing around geographic areas. Example: Many
  multinational companies.

  - **Advantages:** Responsiveness to local market conditions.
  - **Disadvantages:** Duplication of functions, reduced scale economies. Often used in
    combination with functional structures (hybrid).

- **D. Matrix Structure:** Two overlapping hierarchies (e.g., function and product).
  Example: Unilever.
  - **Advantages:** Facilitates coordination between functions (especially important
    for product innovation).
  - **Disadvantages:** Complexity, confusion, conflict, accountability problems.

## IV. Designing Structure: Integrating Mechanisms

- **Integrating Mechanisms:** Methods for coordinating subunits.

- **A. Formal Integrating Mechanisms:**

  - **Direct contact:** Simplest; direct communication between subunit managers.
  - **Liaison roles:** Assigning individuals to coordinate between subunits.
  - **Teams:** Temporary or permanent teams composed of members from different
    subunits.
  - **Matrix structure:** Multiple reporting lines and overlapping hierarchies.

- **B. Informal Integrating Mechanisms: Knowledge Networks:** Networks based on
  informal contacts and information systems; can facilitate nonbureaucratic knowledge
  flow. Example: 3M's use of knowledge networks to facilitate innovation.

## V. Strategy, Coordination, and Integrating Mechanisms:

- The choice of integrating mechanisms depends on the firm's strategy and environment.
  - **High need for coordination:** Firms competing through innovation, facing
    turbulent environments (matrix structures, cross-functional teams).
  - **Low need for coordination:** Stable environments, limited innovation (simple
    liaison roles, direct contact).
  - In diversified firms, the need for integration varies with the type of diversification
    strategy. Related diversification requires more integration.
