# Chapter 11: Developing High-Performance Teams

**I. Why Rely on Teams?**

- **Definition of Teams:** Groups of people who interact, influence each other, are mutually accountable for achieving common goals aligned with organizational objectives, and perceive themselves as a social entity.

- **Benefits of Teams:**

  - Superior decision making (diverse perspectives, knowledge sharing).
  - Increased creativity and innovation.
  - Enhanced organizational flexibility.
  - Improved customer service (broader expertise).
  - Increased employee engagement (fulfillment of social needs).
  - Example: Whole Foods Market's successful use of self-directed teams to improve
    customer service and employee morale.

- **Limitations of Teams:**
  - Process losses: Resources spent on team development and maintenance rather than tasks.
  - Social loafing: Reduced individual effort when working in groups.
  - Requires the right environment (rewards, leadership, communication).
  - Potential for conflict.

**II. Types of Teams:**

1. **Departmental Teams:** Employees with similar skills located within the same functional unit; often minimal task interdependence.

2. **Production/Service/Leadership Teams:** Multiskilled teams producing a common product/service or making ongoing decisions; varying degrees of interdependence.

3. **Self-Directed Teams:**

   - High autonomy: Control over inputs, processes, and outputs; minimal supervision.
   - Responsible for entire work process.
   - Technology support is crucial for effective communication and coordination.
   - Example: Harley-Davidson's assembly plant operating with no supervisors;
     Whole Foods' self-directed teams managing their own inventory and sales. \* _Success Factors:_ Responsibility for an entire work process; sufficient autonomy;
     technology to support team dynamics.

4. **Advisory Teams:** Provide recommendations to decision makers (committees, councils).

5. **Task Force (Project) Teams:** Temporary, multiskilled teams focusing on specific problems or projects.

6. **Skunkworks:** Teams located separately from the main organization with high autonomy and freedom from hierarchical constraints, often initiated by an entrepreneurial leader.

7. **Virtual Teams:** Members operate across space, time, and organizational boundaries, relying on information technologies for communication and coordination. \* _Success Factors:_ Competent team members (communication, self-leadership, emotional intelligence); flexible information technologies; occasional face-to-face interaction. \* Example: Invensys PLC using virtual teams to coordinate projects across multiple time zones.

**III. A Model of Team Effectiveness:**

- **Team Effectiveness:** How the team impacts the organization, individual members, and its own survival (commitment, resource acquisition).

- **Key Elements:**
  - **Organizational and Team Environment:** Rewards, communication systems,
    organizational structure, leadership support.
  - **Team Design:** Task characteristics (structure, complexity, interdependence); team
    size; team composition (skills, knowledge, diversity); team roles (e.g., Belbin's team
    roles).
  - **Team Processes:** Team development (Tuckman's five stages: forming, storming,
    norming, performing, adjourning); team norms (informal rules and expectations); team
    cohesiveness (attraction and motivation to stay); team trust (calculus-based,
    knowledge-based, identification-based); conflict management (task vs. relationship
    conflict).

**IV. Team Processes in Detail:**

1. **Team Development:** Tuckman's five stages; the importance of team building to accelerate development or address setbacks. Example: Milton Elementary School using team building to facilitate teamwork among new staff.

2. **Team Norms:** Informal rules regulating member behavior; how norms develop (initial interactions, critical events, member values); preventing and changing dysfunctional
   norms. Example: The Container Store using huddles to reinforce team norms.

3. **Team Cohesiveness:** Attraction and motivation to remain a team member; factors
   influencing cohesiveness (member similarity, team size, interaction, entry difficulty,
   success, external challenges). Example: Lighthouse Publishing's cohesive team thriving
   in a competitive environment.

4. **Team Trust:** A psychological state of accepting vulnerability; three foundations:

   - Calculus-based trust (sanctions).
   - Knowledge-based trust (predictability and competence).
   - Identification-based trust (shared values, strong emotional bonds).
   - _Swift Trust:_ Initially high trust in new teams based on assumptions about
     competence and shared identity. Trust often decreases over time due to trust
     violations.

5. **Managing Team Conflict:**
   - **Task vs. Relationship Conflict:** Task conflict (constructive) focuses on the problem;
     relationship conflict is personal and destructive.
   - **Conflict Management Styles:** Problem solving (win-win), avoiding, forcing, yielding,
     compromising. Problem-solving is generally preferred, but other styles may be necessary
     depending on the situation. \* **Structural Solutions:** Addressing incompatible goals (superordinate goals);
     managing diverse values and beliefs (improving empathy); reducing task interdependence;
     clarifying roles and responsibilities. Example: Armstrong Worldwide resolving
     conflict by clarifying roles and responsibilities in its cross-functional team.
