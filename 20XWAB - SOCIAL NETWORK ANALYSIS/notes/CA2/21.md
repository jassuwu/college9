## Chapter 21: Epidemics - Concise Notes (Sections 21.2, 21.3, 21.4, 21.5, 21.6)

**21.2 Branching Processes**

- A simple model for epidemic spread on a tree-like network (no cycles).
- Each infected individual infects _k_ others independently with probability _p_.
- **Basic Reproductive Number (R0):** The expected number of new infections from a single infected individual; R0 = _pk_.
- **Epidemic Dichotomy:**
  - R0 < 1: The epidemic dies out with probability 1.
  - R0 > 1: The epidemic persists with a probability > 0. This probability is not 1 because of the randomness in transmission.

**21.3 The SIR Epidemic Model**

- A more general model applicable to any network structure.
- Nodes transition through three states:
  - **Susceptible (S):** Can be infected.
  - **Infectious (I):** Can infect others.
  - **Removed (R):** Immune or dead; no longer infectious or susceptible.
- **Model Parameters:**
  - _p_: Probability of transmission across an edge when a susceptible neighbor interacts with an infectious node.
  - _tI_: Duration (in steps) of the infectious period for a node.
- **Epidemic Progression:** The model simulates the spread of infection step by step, with each infectious node having a probability _p_ of transmitting the disease to each susceptible neighbor. After _tI_ steps, an infectious node becomes removed.
- **Percolation Interpretation:** An equivalent static model is percolation where, before the simulation, edges are independently declared "open" (transmission occurs) or "blocked" (transmission fails) with probabilities _p_ and *(1-*p*)* respectively. Infected nodes are those reachable from initially infected nodes via open edges. This avoids tracking the time-dependent dynamics directly.
- **Reproductive Number (R0):** While a simple dichotomy (like branching processes) doesn't hold for general networks, R0 is still a useful heuristic measure for predicting epidemic spread; higher R0 increases the likelihood of a widespread outbreak.

**21.4 The SIS Epidemic Model**

- Nodes cycle between Susceptible (S) and Infectious (I) states; there is no removed state, allowing reinfection.
- Model Parameters: _p_ (transmission probability) and _tI_ (infectious period).
- Epidemic Dynamics: The epidemic can persist for a much longer time compared to the SIR model because of reinfection. On a finite network, the epidemic dies out with probability 1 once there are no infectious individuals. There is a critical transmission probability (_p_) that dictates whether the epidemic persists or dies out. This is a more complex relationship than that of R0 in the branching process or SIR models.

**21.5 Synchronization**

- Some diseases exhibit synchronized outbreaks across a population, resulting in oscillations in the number of infected individuals over time.

- **SIRS Model:** Extends the SIR model by adding a temporary immune period (R) of duration _tR_ before returning to the susceptible (S) state. This captures temporary immunity found in some diseases.

- **Small-World Networks:** Small-world networks (high clustering and short path lengths), created via models such as the Watts-Strogatz model (rewiring a ring lattice), facilitate synchronization. Long-range links allow rapid spread, enabling simultaneous outbreaks in different parts of the network. Simultaneous outbreaks are followed by troughs due to widespread temporary immunity.

- **Empirical Observations:** Syphilis exhibits oscillations, likely due to temporary immunity and the interconnectedness of contact networks. Gonorrhea (without temporary immunity) does not show similar oscillations.

**21.6 Transient Contacts and the Dangers of Concurrency**

- **Transient Contacts:** Edges (contacts) in the network exist only for specific time windows. This is relevant for diseases like HIV/AIDS where partnerships have limited duration. The timing of contacts strongly affects disease spread.

- **Concurrency:** A node is involved in concurrent partnerships if it has multiple overlapping partnerships. This can significantly increase the spread of a disease, particularly in comparison to serial partnerships (one partnership at a time). Concurrency amplifies the severity of epidemics.
