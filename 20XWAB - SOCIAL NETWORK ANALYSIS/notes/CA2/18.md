## Chapter 18: Power Laws and Rich-Get-Richer Phenomena (Sections 18.1-18.3)

**18.1 Popularity as a Network Phenomenon**

- Popularity exhibits extreme imbalance: a few items achieve widespread recognition while most remain obscure. This is observed across various domains (web pages, books, movies, etc.).

- **Measuring Popularity:** The number of in-links to a webpage serves as a proxy for popularity. The central question is: how is popularity distributed? A naive hypothesis is a normal distribution, implying a rapid decay in the frequency of highly popular items.

**18.2 Power Laws**

- **Empirical Observation:** Popularity distributions frequently follow a power law, meaning the frequency of items with a given popularity _k_ is proportional to 1/_k<sup>c</sup>_ for some exponent _c_. This contrasts with the normal distribution, as power laws exhibit a much slower decay in the frequency of highly popular items.

- **Power Law Characteristics:** Power laws indicate a long tail of less popular items and a significant number of highly popular items, a characteristic of popularity. A log-log plot of frequency versus popularity yields a straight line with slope âˆ’*c*.

**18.3 Rich-Get-Richer Models**

- Power-law distributions arise from positive feedback mechanisms, where popularity reinforces itself.

- **Rich-Get-Richer Dynamics:** The probability of an item gaining popularity is proportional to its current popularity. This is also known as **preferential attachment**.

- **A Simple Model (Web Page Links):**

  1.  Pages are created sequentially.
  2.  When a new page is created, it links to an existing page:
      - With probability _p_, it chooses a page uniformly at random.
      - With probability _(1-p)_, it chooses a page with probability proportional to the page's current number of in-links (preferential attachment).

- This model generates a power-law distribution of in-links, with the exponent _c_ depending on _p_. Lower _p_ (more copying) leads to lower _c_ (more highly popular items).

- **Intuition:** The rich-get-richer mechanism amplifies initial advantages, leading to exponential growth of popular items and a power-law distribution. This model can be applied to other domains beyond the Web, such as city populations and gene copy numbers.
