## Chapter 14: Link Analysis and Web Search - Concise Notes (Sections 14.1-14.3)

**14.1 Searching the Web: The Problem of Ranking**

- Web search faces challenges beyond traditional information retrieval:
  - **Ambiguity:** Keywords have multiple meanings (polysemy) and synonyms exist.
  - **Author Diversity:** Content quality varies greatly; assessing credibility is difficult.
  - **Dynamic Content:** The Web is constantly changing.
  - **Abundance:** The sheer volume of information makes filtering crucial. The task shifts from finding relevant documents to ranking them effectively.

**14.2 Link Analysis Using Hubs and Authorities**

- **Authority:** A page's authority on a topic is determined by the number and quality of in-links from other relevant pages. In-links act as endorsements.

- **Hubs:** Pages that link to multiple authoritative pages on a topic. These function as valuable resource aggregators.

- **Hubs & Authorities Algorithm:** An iterative algorithm to estimate authority and hub scores:

  1.  Initialize all scores to 1.
  2.  **Authority Update:** Each page's authority score is the sum of the hub scores of all pages linking to it.
  3.  **Hub Update:** Each page's hub score is the sum of the authority scores of all pages it links to.
  4.  Repeat steps 2 & 3, normalizing scores after each iteration to prevent unbounded growth. This process converges to a stable state.
  5.  The final scores reflect the relative authority and hub importance of each page. Higher scores indicate greater authority and better ability to identify authoritative sources (hubs).

- **Limitations:** The algorithm doesn't account for link quality (spam, paid links), context, or user behavior.

**14.3 PageRank**

- **PageRank Intuition:** A page's importance is proportional to the importance of the pages that link to it. Emphasizes direct endorsement between prominent pages.

- **PageRank Algorithm:** Iterative algorithm:

  1.  Initialize all PageRank scores to 1/n (n = number of pages).
  2.  **Basic PageRank Update Rule:** Each page distributes its current PageRank equally among its outgoing links. Pages with no outgoing links keep their entire PageRank. Each page's new PageRank is the sum of the PageRank it receives.
  3.  Repeat step 2. PageRank values converge to a steady state.

- **Damping Factor:** The _Basic PageRank Update Rule_ can lead to PageRank concentrating in dead-end parts of the network. The _Scaled PageRank Update Rule_ addresses this by introducing a damping factor (s, typically between 0.8 and 0.9):

  - With probability _s_, the random surfer follows an outgoing link.
  - With probability _(1-s)_, the surfer jumps to a random page. This prevents PageRank from being trapped in dead-ends.

- **Random Walk Interpretation:** PageRank can be interpreted as the stationary distribution of a random walk on the Web graph. The damping factor in the scaled version corresponds to a random jump in the walk.

- **Equilibrium:** The limiting PageRank values represent an equilibrium where the PageRank scores remain unchanged after an update. For strongly connected graphs, this equilibrium is unique.
