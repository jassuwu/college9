## Chapter 19: Cascading Behavior in Networks (Sections 19.1-19.3)

**19.1 Diffusion in Networks**

- This chapter focuses on how behaviors, ideas, and innovations spread through social networks at a local level, contrasting with aggregate population-level models.

- **Local vs. Global Influence:** Individuals are primarily influenced by their immediate neighbors in the network, not the entire population. This is relevant to understanding technology adoption, opinion formation, and other social processes.

- **Diffusion of Innovations:** Empirical studies (e.g., hybrid seed corn adoption, tetracycline adoption by physicians) show that social networks significantly influence the spread of innovations. Factors impacting diffusion include: relative advantage, complexity, observability, trialability, and compatibility. Homophily can hinder diffusion by creating isolated, resistant clusters.

**19.2 Modeling Diffusion Through a Network**

- **Networked Coordination Game:** A model where nodes choose between two behaviors (A and B). The payoff to each node depends on the choices of its neighbors. A simple coordination game is used:

  - Matching behaviors (A-A or B-B) yield positive payoffs (a or b, respectively).
  - Mismatched behaviors (A-B or B-A) yield zero payoff.

- **Threshold Rule:** A node adopts behavior A if at least a fraction _q_ = _b_/(_a_+_b_) of its neighbors are using A (otherwise, it adopts B). This rule is myopic—nodes consider only their immediate neighbors.

- **Cascading Behavior:** A cascade occurs when a small set of initial adopters (starting with behavior A in a network where everyone else uses B) triggers a chain reaction, causing other nodes to switch to behavior A.

- **Complete Cascade:** When the cascade causes all nodes to switch to behavior A. The outcome depends on the network structure, the initial adopters, and the threshold _q_.

**19.3 Cascades and Clusters**

- **Clusters:** A set of nodes where each node has at least a fraction _p_ of its neighbors within the set. Clusters represent densely connected communities.

- **Clusters as Obstacles:** Cascades are blocked by clusters. A key result is that a complete cascade occurs at threshold _q_ if and only if there are no clusters in the remaining (non-adopter) network with density greater than 1 − _q_.

- **Proof Intuition (Part i):** If a cluster of density > 1 − _q_ exists, any node within the cluster will have fewer than _q_ neighbors outside the cluster. This prevents the cascade from spreading _into_ the cluster.

- **Proof Intuition (Part ii):** If a cascade stops, the set of nodes that haven't switched to A forms a cluster with density greater than 1 − _q_. This is because any node on the boundary of the cascade must have fewer than _q_ neighbors using A, and thus more than 1 − _q_ neighbors using B.
