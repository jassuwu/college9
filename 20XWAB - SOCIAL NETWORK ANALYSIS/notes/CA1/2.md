### Chapter 2: Graphs

#### Introduction to Graph Theory
- **Graph Definition**: A graph represents relationships among a collection of items, where nodes (vertices) represent the items and edges (links) represent the relationships between pairs of items. Graphs can be **undirected** (e.g., friendships) or **directed** (e.g., following on Twitter).

#### Basic Definitions
- **Nodes and Edges**: In a graph, nodes are the fundamental units connected by edges. If two nodes are connected by an edge, they are called **neighbors**.
  - **Undirected Graph**: Relationships are bidirectional.
  - **Directed Graph**: Relationships have a direction (e.g., A â†’ B).

#### Graphs as Network Models
- **Examples of Graphs**:
  - **Communication Networks**: Nodes are devices, and edges represent communication links (e.g., the early ARPANET).
  - **Social Networks**: Nodes represent individuals or groups, and edges represent social interactions.
  - **Information Networks**: Nodes are information sources (e.g., web pages), and edges represent hyperlinks or citations.

#### Paths and Connectivity
- **Paths**: A **path** in a graph is a sequence of nodes where each consecutive pair is connected by an edge. Paths can include repeated nodes but are often simple (no repetition).
- **Cycles**: A **cycle** is a path that starts and ends at the same node without repeating other nodes. Cycles are crucial for redundancy in networks.
- **Connectivity**: A graph is **connected** if there is a path between every pair of nodes. If not connected, the graph breaks into **connected components**.
- **Components**: A **connected component** is a subset of nodes such that there is a path between any pair of nodes within this subset, and no larger set satisfies this condition.

#### Giant Components
- **Giant Component**: In large networks, there is often one **giant component** that contains a significant fraction of all nodes. Most nodes in large networks belong to this giant component, while other components are much smaller.

#### Distance and Breadth-First Search
- **Distance**: The **distance** between two nodes is the length of the shortest path connecting them.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A method to explore a graph layer by layer, starting from a source node and moving outward to discover nodes at increasing distances.

#### Small-World Phenomenon
- **Small-World Phenomenon**: In large networks, most nodes can be reached from any other node by a surprisingly short path (e.g., "six degrees of separation").
  - **Milgram's Experiment**: Demonstrated that people are connected by short chains of acquaintances, with a median path length of six.

#### Network Datasets
- **Types of Network Data**:
  - **Collaboration Graphs**: Nodes represent individuals, and edges represent collaborations (e.g., co-authorships in academic papers).
  - **Communication Networks**: Nodes represent users, and edges represent communication links (e.g., email exchanges).
  - **Information Linkage Graphs**: Nodes represent information sources, and edges represent links between them (e.g., web pages and hyperlinks).
  - **Technological Networks**: Nodes represent physical devices, and edges represent physical connections (e.g., the internet's underlying structure).
  - **Biological Networks**: Examples include food webs (who eats whom) and neural networks (connections between neurons).
