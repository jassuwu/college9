## Chapter 11: Network Models of Markets with Intermediaries (Sections 11.2, 11.3)

**11.2 A Model of Trade on Networks**

This section introduces a model of trade on networks where buyers and sellers interact indirectly through intermediaries (traders). The model aims to capture how network structure influences prices and trade outcomes.

- **Model Assumptions:**

  - A single, indivisible good.
  - Each seller has one unit of the good, valued at _v<sub>i</sub>_ (assumed to be 0 for simplicity).
  - Each buyer wants one unit, valued at _v<sub>j</sub>_ (known to all).
  - The network represents trading opportunities: edges connect sellers to traders, and traders to buyers.
  - Traders set bid prices (_b<sub>ti</sub>_) for sellers and ask prices (_a<sub>tj</sub>_) for buyers.

- **Two-Stage Game:**

  1.  **Traders:** Simultaneously set bid and ask prices.
  2.  **Sellers & Buyers:** Simultaneously choose traders (or choose not to trade). They make the choice which maximizes their profit.

- **Payoffs:**

  - **Seller:** _b<sub>ti</sub>_ (if traded), 0 (otherwise).
  - **Buyer:** _v<sub>j</sub>_ − _a<sub>tj</sub>_ (if traded), 0 (otherwise).
  - **Trader:** Profit from successful trades (ask prices − bid prices), minus a penalty for defaulting (not having enough goods to fulfill the buyers' orders).

- **Equilibrium:** A subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (each trader's pricing strategy and each buyer/seller's trading strategy is a best response to the other players' strategies). Sellers and buyers act myopically (choose highest payoff), whereas traders consider the effects of their prices on other traders and buyer/seller decisions.

**11.3 Equilibria in Trading Networks**

This section analyzes equilibria in different network structures.

- **Monopoly:** If a seller or buyer has only one trader to interact with, the trader extracts all the surplus.

- **Perfect Competition:** If multiple traders connect the same seller and buyer, competition drives bid/ask spreads to zero; no profit is made.

- **Implicit Perfect Competition:** Even without direct competition for the same buyer-seller pair, the overall network structure can lead to zero-profit equilibria for all traders. Network topology determines competitive pressure.

- **Second-Price Auction as an Equilibrium:** The model can replicate the second-price auction: with one seller and multiple buyers, the equilibrium price is the second-highest buyer valuation.

- **Ripple Effects:** Adding/removing edges can cause non-local changes in prices and profits. This highlights the interconnectedness of the market and the sensitivity of outcomes to structural changes.

- **Efficiency:** Every equilibrium produces a flow of goods that maximizes total social welfare (the difference between buyers' and sellers' valuations). Traders may or may not receive positive profits depending on their essential role in achieving the optimal allocation. A trader receives positive profit only if they have an _essential edge_: the removal of this edge changes the social welfare.
