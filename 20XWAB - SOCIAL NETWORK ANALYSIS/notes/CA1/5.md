## Chapter 5: Positive and Negative Relationships (Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4)

**5.1 Structural Balance**

- **Signed Graphs:** Represent social networks where edges are labeled "+" (friendship) or "-" (enmity). Assumes mutual awareness of relationships.

- **Balanced Triads:** Triads (sets of three nodes) are considered balanced if they have either three "+" edges (mutual friendship) or exactly one "+" edge (two friends with a common enemy). Unbalanced triads (two "+" edges, one "-" or three "-" edges) create psychological tension.

- **Structural Balance:** A network is structurally balanced if _all_ its triads are balanced. This implies a global structure.

**5.2 Characterizing the Structure of Balanced Networks (Balance Theorem)**

- **Balance Theorem:** A structurally balanced signed complete graph (every pair of nodes is connected by a signed edge) must have either:

  - All positive edges (everyone is friends).
  - Two groups of mutual friends with complete antagonism between the groups (negative edges connecting nodes in different groups).

- **Proof:** The proof proceeds by contradiction. Starting from a balanced graph with at least one negative edge, it shows that choosing any node as a starting point for defining the two groups and partitioning the nodes based on their relationship (positive or negative) with that node generates the balanced structure described above.

**5.3 Applications of Structural Balance**

- **International Relations:** Structural balance provides a framework for understanding alliances and conflicts between nations. Alliances are often driven by a need to minimize unbalanced triads in the network. This can lead to the formation of two major opposing alliances.

- **Online Social Media:** Users can express positive or negative opinions about each other, forming networks with signed edges. Analysis of online rating systems reveals a complex interplay of positive and negative relations, sometimes resembling structural balance, but often with additional layers of complexity (e.g., directed graphs). Trust/distrust relationships often depend on context and donâ€™t always align perfectly with structural balance.

**5.4 A Weaker Form of Structural Balance**

- **Criticism of Structural Balance:** The original definition of structural balance may be too restrictive, as it equally penalizes triads with three negative edges and triads with two positive and one negative edge. The former may be less inherently unstable than the latter.

- **Weak Structural Balance:** A weaker definition of balance, requiring only that there are no triads with exactly two positive edges and one negative edge. Allows for triads with three negative edges.

- **Weakly Balanced Networks:** Nodes can be partitioned into multiple groups such that all edges within groups are positive, and edges between groups are negative. This allows for more complex social structures than the original structural balance theory.

- **Proof:** A proof similar to the Balance Theorem's, but less restrictive, demonstrates this. The key idea is that only having two positive edges is what causes instability; all that is needed to obtain a weakly balanced network is the ability to partition nodes into groups.
