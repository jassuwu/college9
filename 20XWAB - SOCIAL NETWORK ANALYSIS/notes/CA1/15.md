## Chapter 15: Sponsored Search Markets (Sections 15.1, 15.2, 15.3)

**15.1 Advertising Tied to Search Behavior**

- **Keyword-Based Advertising:** A highly effective advertising model where ads are displayed alongside search results, targeted to user queries. This contrasts with traditional impression-based advertising.

- **Cost-Per-Click (CPC):** Advertisers pay only when a user clicks on their ad. This model incentivizes creating relevant and appealing ads. CPC values are set through auctions.

- **Auction Mechanisms:** Search engines use auctions to allocate advertising slots and determine CPC prices. Multiple slots exist, with higher-positioned slots having higher clickthrough rates.

**15.2 Advertising as a Matching Market**

- **Matching Market Framework:** The allocation of advertising slots to advertisers can be modeled as a matching market.

  - **Sellers:** Advertising slots (with clickthrough rates _r<sub>i</sub>_).
  - **Buyers:** Advertisers (with revenues per click _v<sub>j</sub>_).
  - **Valuation:** Advertiser _j_'s valuation for slot _i_ is _v<sub>ij</sub> = r<sub>i</sub>v<sub>j</sub>_. This assumes that clickthrough rates are independent of the ad content.

- **Market-Clearing Prices:** Prices are set to ensure that each advertiser receives a different slot and that the allocation maximizes the total valuation among advertisers. This allocation generally gives the highest clickthrough rate slot to the advertiser with the highest revenue per click and so on.

- **Equalizing Numbers of Slots and Advertisers:** If the number of slots and advertisers differ, fictitious slots/advertisers with zero valuation are added to create an equal number for analysis.

**15.3 Encouraging Truthful Bidding in Matching Markets: The VCG Principle**

- **Challenges of Direct Bidding:** If advertisers directly bid their revenues per click, they have incentive to underbid. This creates market instability and high transaction costs (constant bid adjustments).

- **Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) Mechanism:** A generalization of the second-price auction to matching markets. Incentivizes truthful bidding.

- **VCG Principle:** The price a buyer pays for an item is equal to the total increase in valuation that other buyers would receive if this buyer were not present in the auction.

- **VCG Procedure:**

  1.  Advertisers announce valuations (which may not be truthful).
  2.  The socially optimal allocation (maximizing total valuation) is computed using these announced valuations.
  3.  Each advertiser pays the harm they impose on other advertisers through their allocation.

- **Dominant Strategy:** Truthful bidding is a dominant strategy under the VCG mechanism. This is because a buyer's payoff is only affected by her allocation, which is always optimal given her _true_ valuation. The price paid always reflects the harm this buyer imposes on the rest of the population.
