## Chapter 12: Bargaining and Power in Networks (Sections 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 12.8)

**12.1 Power in Social Networks**

- **Power as a Relational Property:** Power is not solely an individual attribute but a property of the relationship between two individuals. It's about the ability to influence the distribution of value in an exchange.

- **Network Exchange Theory:** Studies how network structure influences power in social exchanges. Value is created through relationships, but its distribution can be unequal.

- **Sources of Power:** Several factors contribute to power imbalances in social networks:
  - **Dependence:** A node's power increases with its access to alternative exchange partners, decreasing the dependence on a particular partner.
  - **Exclusion:** Powerful nodes can selectively exclude others from beneficial exchanges.
  - **Satiation:** Powerful nodes, receiving higher value from exchanges, may be less motivated to engage in further exchanges, giving them additional leverage.
  - **Centrality Measures (e.g., betweenness):** Centrality can indicate power, but it's not always a reliable predictor in exchange networks. Simple centrality measures can be misleading; more nuanced measures are often necessary.

**12.2 Experimental Studies of Power and Exchange**

- **Experimental Design:** Controlled experiments use small networks (often paths or trees) to investigate power dynamics. Individuals negotiate over the division of a resource (usually money) on each edge of a network, subject to exchange rules.

- **One-Exchange Rule:** A common restriction where each individual can engage in at most one exchange in a round. This introduces strategic decision-making on who to exchange with.

- **Experimental Variation:** Experiments vary information availability, the number of allowed exchanges per node, and the length of negotiations to explore different aspects of power dynamics.

**12.3 Results of Network Exchange Experiments**

- **Short Paths:** Experiments confirm that individuals in more central positions (especially those able to exclude others) tend to receive a greater share of the resource. The specific outcome depends on the network structure, the exchange rule, and information availability.

- **Path Length Effects:**

  - **2-Node Path:** Approximately equal division.
  - **3-Node Path:** Central node receives a highly disproportionate share.
  - **4-Node Path:** Central nodes receive a significantly larger share than the end nodes.
  - **5-Node Path:** Central node does not have a strong advantage.

- **The Importance of Network Structure:** Outcomes are heavily influenced by the network's structure. Simple centrality measures may not accurately reflect power. The ability to exclude partners is crucial to gaining a power advantage.

**12.5 Modeling Two-Person Interaction: The Nash Bargaining Solution**

- **Nash Bargaining Solution:** A model for two-person bargaining, considering outside options (the payoff each would obtain if negotiations fail). Assumes equal bargaining power absent other information.

- **Equidependent Outcome:** Predicts that when two individuals bargain over a resource, with outside options _x_ and _y_, and _x_+_y_<1, they split the surplus (1−*x*−*y*) equally.

- **Status Effects:** Experiments suggest that perceived status influences bargaining power, leading to deviations from the equidependent outcome. Higher-status individuals tend to obtain more favorable outcomes.

**12.6 Modeling Two-Person Interaction: The Ultimatum Game**

- **Ultimatum Game:** One player proposes a split of a resource, and the other player can accept or reject (rejecting results in both players receiving nothing). This is a highly asymmetric bargaining setting.

- **Rational Prediction (Money Maximization):** The proposer should offer a minimal amount to the responder. However, experiments show that proposers often offer more equal splits, and responders often reject low offers.

- **Non-Monetary Payoffs:** The results suggest that individuals value fairness and that social preferences such as aversion to unfairness affect their decision-making. Utility functions must include non-monetary factors to accurately predict behavior.

**12.7 Modeling Network Exchange: Stable Outcomes**

- **Outcome:** A matching (specifying exchanges) and a value assigned to each node.

- **Instability:** An edge not in the matching, connecting two nodes whose values sum to less than 1, indicating that both could obtain a higher payoff by engaging in an exchange.

- **Stable Outcome:** An outcome with no instabilities. Captures a sense of equilibrium in which no pair of nodes would deviate by making a profitable exchange. Predicts outcomes in network exchange experiments reasonably well but does not fully explain cases with weak power imbalances.

**12.8 Modeling Network Exchange: Balanced Outcomes**

- **Balanced Outcome:** Each exchange represents the Nash Bargaining solution, with outside options derived from the values of other nodes in the network.

- **Relationship to Stable Outcomes:** All balanced outcomes are stable, but not all stable outcomes are balanced. Balance refines stability by accounting for outside options in exchanges.

- **Predictive Power:** Balanced outcomes provide a more accurate approximation of experimental results, especially in networks with multiple stable outcomes. They capture the effects of different network structures on power.
