## Chapter 4: Networks in Their Surrounding Contexts (Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5)

**4.1 Homophily**

- **Homophily:** The principle that individuals tend to form ties with similar others (birds of a feather flock together). Observed across various dimensions (race, age, occupation, interests, etc.).

- **Contextual Effects:** Homophily arises from both intrinsic network effects (e.g., triadic closure) and contextual factors (e.g., shared school, workplace). Contextual factors create opportunities for link formation between similar individuals.

- **Measuring Homophily:** A numerical measure compares the observed frequency of links between nodes of different types to the expected frequency if links were formed randomly, given the overall proportions of types in the network. Significant deviations indicate homophily or inverse homophily (e.g., opposite-sex couples).

**4.2 Mechanisms Underlying Homophily: Selection and Social Influence**

- **Selection:** Individuals choose friends similar to themselves (immutable characteristics like race are mainly explained by selection). Operates at various levels of intentionality.

- **Social Influence:** Individuals' behaviors are shaped by their friends' behaviors (mutable characteristics like opinions are partially explained by social influence, and partially by selection). The relative contributions of selection and social influence are difficult to separate using cross-sectional data but can be explored using longitudinal data.

- **Interplay of Selection and Social Influence:** Studies show that both selection and social influence are at play in shaping homophily, but the relative importance of each varies across different characteristics. This understanding is important for designing interventions (e.g., programs to curb drug use or obesity).

**4.3 Affiliation**

- **Social Foci:** Shared activities, organizations, or places where interactions occur (workplaces, clubs, schools, etc.).

- **Affiliation Networks:** Bipartite graphs representing the relationship between individuals and foci. Illustrates how shared foci facilitate link formation in social networks.

- **Focal Closure:** Individuals who share a focus (social activity) are more likely to become friends. A form of selection (choosing friends based on similarity).

- **Membership Closure:** A person is more likely to join a focus if their friends are already members. A form of social influence.

- **Co-evolution:** Social networks and affiliation networks co-evolve: shared foci create opportunities for friendships, and friendships influence focus choices.

**4.5 A Spatial Model of Segregation (Schelling Model)**

- **Model Description:** Agents of two types (e.g., representing race) occupy cells on a grid. Each agent has a preference to have a minimum number (threshold) of similar neighbors. Unsatisfied agents move to more preferred locations.

- **Segregation Emergence:** Global segregation patterns emerge from local preferences of individuals. Even a weak preference for not being in a small minority leads to significant segregation, which is amplified by a higher threshold.

- **Model Dynamics:** Simulations show that, starting from a mixed population, the system tends towards segregation, even if no agent explicitly desires it. The “unraveling” of integrated regions explains how segregation intensifies over time. Segregation is a consequence of individual choices, not necessarily a deliberate goal.

- **Limitations:** While the model is straightforward to define, the mathematical analysis of its properties is complex. Simulations show the robustness of the basic result, but rigorous theoretical analyses remain incomplete.
